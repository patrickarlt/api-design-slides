# Why do we need to care about API design
* We need to feel confident that we are doing all we<br> can to help developers build great apps.
* Lets developers build apps insteed of <br>reading documentation or learning terminology

# Good API design makes things better for everyone.

# Developers in ArcGIS organizations like that...
* Our APIs are consistant and when we<br> release new feature there is nothing to relearn
* All our APIs behave in a similar manner<br> and share similar defaults and concepts

# "Application" developers like that...
* Our APIs have much more functionality <br> then similar tools from Goggle or MapQuest<br> without adding to much complexity

# Developers inside Esri like that...
* new features can be accessed quickly and easily
* New staff can be onboarded faster because APIs are consistant


# Questions we need to ask...
* How to our APIs compare to our competitors APIs?
* Are our APIs accessible and easy to understand?
* How easy is it to find what you need in an API or SDK?
* Are we reavealing the complexity our<br> APIs over time insteed of all at once?

# Current API and SDK review
<br>
Things that **WILL** throw off new developers in the system

## Service URLs
<br>
ArcGIS services like directions and geocoding exist at differnt URLs.<br>
This is a strength of the platform but it makes life harder for developers.

Developers should not have to worry about what the correct URL is.

## Proposal
* `new esri.tasks.RouteTask()` - Use the default hosted service.
* `new esri.tasks.RouteTask(url)` - Use the service hosted at this url.

## Parameter Names
* Parameter names are not consistantly capitalized the same way
* Mismatches between what SDK and API parameter names
* Confusing parameter names that do not describe what they do
* Inflexible parameter names that describe only one use case
* Default options often do not make sense

### Example #1 - Capitalization
<br>
Most parameter names in the API are camelcase. Except for<br> geocoding where some but not all parameters are uppercase.
<br>
`Address`, `Neighborhood`, `City`, `searchExtent`, `location`.

### Example #2 - Capitalization
<br>
Parameter names for the Sycnronous Service Area request are<br> camalCase but in the Asyncronous Service Area are Captialized.

### Example #2 - Inconsistant Naming
<br>
To geocode a single line address or search with <br> `esri.tasks.Locator` the API parameter is called `text`.
<br>
In the Javascript SDK it is called `"Single Line Input"`

### Example #3 - Confusing Names
<br>
In the drive time/service area API you define the times <br> you want to calculate by setting the `defaultBreaks` parameter.

The parameter name does not describe<br> what the it does and will confuse developers.

This also accepts a string of numbers "5 60" but <br>why not an array like [5, 60] which is easier to construct.

Why not call this parameter `time`? Which more accuratly <br>descirbes what it does in the context of calculating a driveTime

### Example #4 - Inflexible Names
<br>
In the nearest place/closest facilities API <br>there are parameters for `incidents` and `facilities`.

Why do I do if I want to get directions to the nearest bar?
<br>
Do I put my location as a facility and the bars as incidents?

This feels like it was designed only to handle <br> very specific use cases. Routing police cars <br>to crimes and ambulences to hospitals

In reality we have no idea what developers will build

Why not name these `origins` and `destinations`?

### Example #5 - Sane Defaults
<br>
By default the directions API returns driving directions with requests.<br>By default the Javascript SDK sets this to `false`.

## Response Consistancy
* Geocoding with single line, multi line <br> and reverse geocoding do not return similar results.
* Some areas in responses are completly empty

### Example #1 - Geocoding

Geocoding the single line "420 SW Taylor St Portland Or"<br> returns and array of `locations`

Geocoding the multiline address "420 SW Taylor St Portland Or"<br> returns and array of `canidates`

Why are these different. Why you <br>call this repsonse parameter `results`?

Reverse geocoding returns a single `location` and <br> components of an address but no full address.

### Example #2 - Directions Responses
<br>
`response.routeResults[0].directions.strings` <br>is an array of empty strings. But It seems like a logical<br> place to store all the text directions

## Data Quality
* Geocoder search results are not complete
* Geocoder cannot autocomplete results
* Maps are over/under labeled

### Example #1 - Place Search
<br>
When I ask for `"coffee shops portland or"` I get mostly Starbucks.

### Example #2 - Geocoder Autocomplete
<br>
The Geocoder cannot be used to do any sort <br>of auto competetion. `Tex` will not auto-complete to `Texas`.

This makes it impossible to build a good autocompleting search.

### Example #3
<br>
Map labeling is really inconsistant...

!["Over Labeled"](img/over-labeled.jpg "background")

!["Under Labeled"](img/under-labeled.jpg "background")

# Things have been improving

## Javascipt API Basemaps

New `basemap` parameter in `esri.Map` is awesome.

## Spatial Reference Abstraction

`esri.Map` and `esri.geometry.Point` no longer require spatialReference

Most methods will automatically convert<br> between Geographic and Web Mercator

## Geocoder Widget
<br>
This is a really good UI component that sovles a problem.

But it is limted by the capabilities of the Geocoder.

# API Design Principles

## Consistancy
<br>
Good APIs are consistant. They do that same thing all the time.

They feel like they were written and created by the same people.

## Clarity
<br>
APIs and SDKs should be clear enough developers <br>do not have to refer to documentation all the time.

## Reduce Work
<br>
* Leverage our network of services to help solve problems
* Identify opportunities to link services togather

What if we could input addresses into the directions API?

What if we could find the nearest place in a feature service?

Geotriggers and Context APIs are doing things like this.

## Sensible Defaults
<br>
All services should try to make sure that developers<br> never have to change 80% of the defulat options.

## Require the least possible knowledge
Developers should not have to know or <br>learn GIS terms when using our tools.

We should not make develoeprs learn <br>another library or service to use our tools.

## Organize around the 80%
<br>
We should organize documentation around <br>the 80% of tasks taht developers commonly want to preform.

## Provide different levels of SDK integrations
<br>
We should not force developers to one particular path or toolset

### Basic
<br>
Solves the problem at eh lowest possible level

`esri.request`

### or
<br>
A small API wrapper that handles authentication

### Intermediate
<br>
`esri.Geocode.address()`

* Has knowlage of the Geocoder Service URL
* Turns JSON response into SDK objects

Lets developers interact with the service <br>easily but gives them alot of control

### Advanced
<br>
`esri.Geocode.Widget()`

A full fledged UI component for Geocoding.

Handles building a UI and all <br>accociated events and behaviors.
Saves developers time so they don't <br>have to build the same UI over again

  <script>
  var converter = new Showdown.converter();
  var slides = document.body.innerHTML.split("\n\n");
  document.body.innerHTML = "";
  for(var i=0; i<slides.length-1; i++) {
    console.log(i);
    document.body.innerHTML += "<div>" + converter.makeHtml(slides[i]) + "</div>";
  }
